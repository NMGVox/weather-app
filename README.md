# weather-app
A simplistic, browser-based weather application comaptible with responsive design and mobile comapatibility.

This application utilizes asynchronous calls to weatherAPI.com to collect data on a city based on user input. Provided are 3-Day forecasts, hourly forecasts (up to 24 hours), and weather conditions.

Users can save their most frequently searched cities that can be accessed from the favorites menu. This is currently done through local storage, but there are future plans to bring a back-end into the project where users can log in and have their favorites stored in a server-side database.
